Work-Projects-AutoUpdate-Shortcut-Injector
==========================================

Work Projects AutoUpdate Shortcut Injector is a simple application that runs through all the Work Project folders in a specified base folder, injecting an AutoUpdate program shortcut into the Advanced Installer .aip build file, ensuring that the shortcut and AutoUpdate icon is in fact in the project's Installer Folder (if AutoUpdate.exe is detected as being in the Required Files folder). The program also updates the Uninstall shortcut.  Created by Craig Lotter, November 2007
